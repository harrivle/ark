# TODO: The intended behavior is to be able to import models directly, i.e. `import models.EmptyModel`. This cannot be
#   done without needing to install every model package. Possible solution is to restructure every model into its own
#   module. Another (current) solution is to check if the package is installed before import. See `set_model()` in
#   api/app.py.
